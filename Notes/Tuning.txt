    Fuel Trims
    Air Fuel Ratio
    
Fuel Delivery
    Short term fuel trim (STFT) = AF Correction #1
    Long term fuel trim (LTFT) = AF Learning #1

    Ideally you want the short and long term fuel trims sitting at 0 but +/- 5% is acceptable
    A positive number means the ecu is adding fuel to match the targeted a/f
    A negative number means the ecu is removing fuel to match the target a/f
    These values are found in the Learning Table Values

    Higher air fuel ratio is lean
    Lower air fuel ratio is rich
    Stoichmetric ratio is 14.7

    Volumetric efficiency table
    Need to scale if ecu uses the MAP sensor to calculate load

    Formulas for
        Total ignition timing
        Target a/f

Ignition Timing
    Tuning Strategy
        Perform a run
        Add 2 degrees of timing
        Check effects on hp and tq

    Higher timing is advanced
    Lower timing is retarded

    Goal is to find Maxium Brake Torque (MBT) timing
    Keep a 2-3 degree saftey margin from the onset of knock
    
    For turbo engines begin tuning the ignition timing
    At the lowest boost level (wastegate spring pressure - 0% wgdc)
    Once ignition is figured out we can add our desired boost target

    Keep the ignition timing table a smooth shape
    Limit the change between cells to no more than 4-5 degrees

MAF Scaling
    Most important table since it controls loads which is used by timing, fueling and boost tables

    Measuring the error in the a/f being commanded and the a/f being recorded in the exhaust
    When theres an error the ecu thinks there is more or less air entering the engine

    If we find that the a/f is 5% leaner than target, this could be corrected by increasing the MAF sensor 
        calibration at this voltage by 5%

    Useful to perform long terms so that you can use averages

    Calculate change to MAF scaling with following equation
    pi x radius ^ 2
    radius = diamter / 2
    new housing sectional area / old housing sectional area
    After getting the percentage you can multiply all values in the MAF table by result

Injector Scaling
    2 techniques
    Simple: Injector flow scaling and injector latency
    Advanced: Pulse width, fuel pressure and battery voltage
        injectors will supply values to copy into ecu tables

    Start by checking the fuel trims at cruise and adjust the injector scaling from there
    If the trims are +10% the ecu thinks the injectors are bigger than they are and is supplying less fuel
        In this case decrease the injector scaling by the same amount as the trim percentage

    Once the cruising trims are close move on the idle and make changes to the latency values
    If trims are positive the injectors need to be opened longer and increase the latency numbers
    Changing latency values has a smaller effect on the cruise tune

    Imposssible to tune a car that has a bigger intake / larger maf and also larger injectors
    Tune for one at a time 

Boost Control
    0% wastegate duty cycle = open (no boost)
    100% wastegate duty cycle = closed (max boost)

    Always make small changes
    Need to adjust the wastegate duty tables in order to reach our target boost 

Transient Tuning / Transient Enrichment
    Required to ensure stable control over the air fuel ratios as the throttle is opened/closed rapidly

    Fuel film is created on the cyclinder walls
    High load and pressure there is a larger film
    Low load and pressure there is a smaller film

    During the transient event the cylinder is not receiving all the fuel from the injector hence it will run 
        lean momentarily, opposite situation when sharply closed 
    
    Based on rate of change of throttle position, but its really the change in manifold pressure that is key
        to transient enrichment 

    If tuning for larger injectors you can scale the transient table by injector size
    Larger injectors will have a smaller transient value 

Configure Base Tune
    Disable DTCs
    Scale MAF or MAP sensors
    Setup injectors
    Fuel Trims atleast +-20%

Optimising the Tune
    Get the car to run / idle
    Get the car to do a full WOT
    Optimize for best hp / tq 

    If knock is present retard the timing 
    When no knock is present lean out the fuel to hit target afr 

    If MAF scaled correctly the recorded afr should match the afr in the map
    If its off by a few percent we can adjust the afr in the map
    Correction Factor = Mesured AFR / Target AFR 

    Once fuel is accurate we can optimize the ignition timing
    Add by 2 degrees until getting close to mbt (maxium brake torque) or knock occurs

    Start with minimum or wastegate boost pressure then slowly increase the boost

Steady state tuning
    Tuning MAF
    First do close loop, use gas and left foot braking to get data
    Then do WOT 
    Ignore cells that were in closed loop
    Ignore data at the beginning of WOT because there is a delay in adjusting to the tart afr 

    Tuning SD 
    Create a histogram for RPM x MAP 
    Same as MAF start getting closed loop data then WOT
    Make changes to volumetric efficiency tables 

After Tune
    Check cruising fuel trims
    Best to have fuel trims slightly negative (rich)
    Short and long term cruise fuel trims +- 3%
    Long term fuel trims can be disabled
    Total trim = short + long term fuel trim
    Want to be close to 0

    Next WOT
    Looking at fuel control afr compared to commanded afr 
    Looking for knock 
    Use high enough gear to get higher load

    Next transient response of engine
    Response of sharp inputs
    Check for knock in gear changes
    Whats happening at medium load
    50-75% throttle mid range

    Create a spark retard histogram -> (timing table) RPM x load or maf (cylinder airmass g)
    Retard the timing 
    Smooth change to timing table

    Gray tables are not defined / don't exists

Base Tune
    Requested torque

    For bigger turbos better to lower boost target in spool cells since we wont be hitting these targets and it will throw off the boost corrections / over boost 

    Initial and Max Wastegate Duty tables
    Maintain a 15% difference between the 2 tables
    The intial dc is the transition from open loop to closed loop
    Make changes to one table then copy to other table and +-15%

    Primary Open loop
    Set all cells used in run to 11.61 (before maf scaling)
    Gets a better result if all cells set to same target

    Close loop fueling
    Remove delays as they can cause issues when adding boost (knock)
    Want to make the transition more rich
    Step 3: 16:30
    Target the last 2 columns when car is entering boost
    Removing cl to ol delays is recommended
    Set Cl to OL Delay to 0
    Set CL Delay Max engine speed by gear to 2500

    Injectors
    Update injector flow scaling
    Injector latency
    
    MAF
    MAF Sensor Scaling
    Measure old vs new intake and change table by percentage of difference

    Ignition Timing
    Subaru has a base ignition table then additional tables that can add or subtract to this base based on the knock control system
        Might be multiple tables (AVCS) but always compare because they might have the same values
        Copy values to other tables
    In ECUFlash you can press the H key for horizonal interpolation
        V key for vertical interpolation
    IAM Ignition Advance Multiplier used in total timing calculation (also known as dynamic advance multiplier DAM)
    Some Subarus have tables for the amount the ecu can retard timing
        Personal preference is to reduce the amount of control the ecu has, so reduce these values
        From 15 degrees to 6 degrees, more than enough for a tuned engine
        Interpolate the leftover values
        After doing this you need to add timing back into the base ignition table since you reduced the amount of timing the ecu can advance
    
    Requested Torque
    There is a Requested Torque table = throttle angle x engine speed
    Changes the throttle body response
    This is how sport modes work, makes it more responsive

    Rev Limiter
    On/off difference = 50

    Speed Limiter
    On/off difference = 2 set to 200

    The rear o2 sensor in Subarus have a lot of power and can cause issues, best to delete it
    Can replace it with a wideband

    Last step is to disable dtc codes

MAF / Injector Scaling
    Subaru engines have an issue in the 2400 to 3200 light load into boost maf scaling creates errors
    Map compensation table
    Fuel system design causes this
    Gather MAF data outside of these ranges

    Logging parameters
        AF Correction #1 = stft based on front o2 sensor
        AF Learning #1 = long term fuel trim
        AF Sensor #1 = Front o2 sensor
        CL/OL Fueling = 8 closed / 10 open loop
        Enging Load (1 byte)**
        Engine Speed
        Feedback Knock Correction = Instant response to knock
        Fine Knock Learning = response overtime

    You can check the MAF sensor voltage, on subaru its 0-5v, if close to 5v will need to upgrade in order to run more boost

    On Subaru engines youll see when you first enter boost that you run lean
    This is the due to the fueling issue

    Set the scaling of the AFR gauge, final fueling and AFR sensor to be the same, this is needed because the gauge has a larger range of values and makes the graph misleading

    You can create custom fields by going to mega log viewer > calculated fields > Custom Fields

    Check the MAF Sensor limit and MAF reading, might need to increase the limit

    Some subarus allow you to set the base IAM value

    when tuning you dont want heat soak, cold start enrichments and the car should be at operating temps
    Smooth with the throttle, dont want any transient acceleration enrichments
    Long runs, smoth on the throttle

    If you haven't disabled the rear o2 sensor you also want to log AF correction #3

    Run 3 tests
        Low RPM up until weird fueling issues / goes to OL
        Higher RPM just above weird fueling issues
        WOT run
            looking at wideband and error between commanded 
            learned short and long term trims will be carried over which is a trap
            need to reset the ecu and those learned trims
            tools > LTV > Reset ECU
        Goal is to hit all cells in the MAF sensor scaling

    CL/OL value of 7 is warmup mode

    When CL/OL status is 7 (warm up) fuel trims are not taken into account and factory o2 sensor is not being used

    Reviewing logs @ 39 minutes
        Reset the ecu between runs to make sure the trims are reset mainly for the WOT run
        Do a slow run up until the subaru fueling issue around 2000 rpm

        Check that there is a smooth increase in MAF Sensor voltage
        First run you want to disregard the wideband data and open loop data, just want to look at the fuel trims
        A/F correction and learning #1, use total trim to analyze

        Disregard total trim as youre coming off idle
        Postive total trim = afr is lean = ecu is adding fuel = target afr - total trim
        Negative total trim = afr is rich = ecu is subtracting fuel = target afr + total trim

        Use the MAf Sensor Scaling histogram in Mega log viewer
        Again ignore logs when coming off throttle

        Do a second run going from 4000 to high rpm
        Trying to hit as many cells in the Maf sensor scaling table

        Do a WOT run 2000-7000 rpm
        No we are interested in the afr values
        We want to set a fixed afr value of 11.61
        Compare the afr gauge to the final fueling value
        Higher value = lean / Lower value = rich
        We want to use the AFR Error custom parameter instead of the total trim parameter

        Get a general idea of what the average value is from the histogram
        Better to underestimate
        Ignore the 2800 - 3800 rpm range fuel issue

    Now we can hop over to the MAF Sensor Scaling table
    Want to keep a generally smooth curve
    In the example he wants to reduce the lower range by 2.5% so he multiplies these values by 0.975
    In the upper range he was rich by 5% so he multiplies it by 0.96
    Negative Total Trim = AFR Rich = Lower MAF Sensor = * < 1 = Because we arent seeing as much air as we thought
    Positive Total Trim = AFR LEAN = Higher MAF Sensor = * > 1 = Because we are seeing more air than we thought
    Then those inbetween cells and multiplies them by the difference between the upper and lower changes
    Flash and then repeat

    @ 59:00 he talks about fixing the fueling issues for newer subarus

Fuel Delivery
    Short term fuel trim (STFT) = AF Correction
    Long term fuel trim (LTFT) = AF Learning

    Ideally you want the short and long term fuel trims sitting at 0 but +/- 5% is acceptable
    A positive number means the ecu is adding fuel to match the targeted a/f
    A negative number means the ecu is removing fuel to match the target a/f
    These values are found in the Learning Table Values

    Higher air fuel ratio is lean
    Lower air fuel ratio is rich
    Stoichmetric ratio is 14.7

    Need to scale if ecu uses the MAP sensor to calculate load

    Formulas for
        Total ignition timing
        Target a/f

Ignition Timing
    Tuning Strategy
        Perform a run
        Add 2 degrees of timing
        Check effects on hp and tq

    Higher timing is advanced
    Lower timing is retarded

    Goal is to find Maxium Brake Torque (MBT) timing
    Keep a 2-3 degree saftey margin from the onset of knock
    
    For turbo engines begin tuning the ignition timing
    At the lowest boost level (wastegate spring pressure - 0% wgdc)
    Once ignition is figured out we can add our desired boost target

    Keep the ignition timing table a smooth shape
    Limit the change between cells to no more than 4-5 degrees

MAF Scaling
    Most important table since it controls loads which is used by timing, fueling and boost tables

    Measuring the error in the a/f being commanded and the a/f being recorded in the exhaust
    When theres an error the ecu thinks there is more or less air entering the engine

    If we find that the a/f is 5% leaner than target, this could be corrected by increasing the MAF sensor 
        calibration at this voltage by 5%

    Useful to perform long terms so that you can use averages

    Calculate change to MAF scaling with following equation
    pi x radius ^ 2
    radius = diamter / 2
    new housing sectional area / old housing sectional area
    After getting the percentage you can multiply all values in the MAF table by result

Injector Scaling
    2 techniques
    Simple: Injector flow scaling and injector latency
    Advanced: Pulse width, fuel pressure and battery voltage
        injectors will supply values to copy into ecu tables

    Start by checking the fuel trims at cruise and adjust the injector scaling from there
    If the trims are +10% the ecu thinks the injectors are bigger than they are and is supplying less fuel
        In this case decrease the injector scaling by the same amount as the trim percentage

    Once the cruising trims are close move on the idle and make changes to the latency values
    If trims are positive the injectors need to be opened longer and increase the latency numbers
    Changing latency values has a smaller effect on the cruise tune

    Imposssible to tune a car that has a bigger intake / larger maf and also larger injectors
    Tune for one at a time 

Boost Control
    0% wastegate duty cycle = open (no boost)
    100% wastegate duty cycle = closed (max boost)

    Always make small changes
    Need to adjust the wastegate duty tables in order to reach our target boost 

Transient Tuning / Transient Enrichment
    Required to ensure stable control over the air fuel ratios as the throttle is opened/closed rapidly

    Fuel film is created on the cyclinder walls
    High load and pressure there is a larger film
    Low load and pressure there is a smaller film

    During the transient event the cylinder is not receiving all the fuel from the injector hence it will run 
        lean momentarily, opposite situation when sharply closed 
    
    Based on rate of change of throttle position, but its really the change in manifold pressure that is key
        to transient enrichment 

    If tuning for larger injectors you can scale the transient table by injector size
    Larger injectors will have a smaller transient value
